# Reaction-Game
Capacitive sensor reaction reaction game written in 8051 assembly using the AT89LP51RC2 microcontroller. Produces an audible signal using a speaker, wait for players input from capacitive sensors, decides who wins the round, and keeps a record of 
points for each player using the LCD. Capacitance variations were detected using a 555 timer on an a-stable oscillator configuration 

# Game Rules
a. The game will produce either a 2100Hz tone or a 2000Hz tone randomly using the CEM-1023 speaker. 
b. If the tone is 2100Hz, the first player to press its capacitor sensor wins a point. 
c. If the tone is 2000Hz, the first  player that presses its capacitor sensor loses a point. 
d. The LCD displays the points for each player. 
e. The first player to reach 5 points wins the game!
